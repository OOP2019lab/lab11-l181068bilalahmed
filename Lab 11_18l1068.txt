Answer 6
(a)
So that the members are accessed only through getters/setters, and are controlled by us. This way the the derived classes do not get direct access to the private members.

(b & c)

cout << f_name() << " " << l_name() << " is " << age << " years old, his cgpa is " << cgpa << endl;

Private members f_name, l_name cannot be directly accessed by the class student, therefore, the function can be called using getters for the variables, this way the function will run smoothly.

Answer 8

The derived classes are inheriting the public functions/ members as protected functions and the private functions/ members remain the same.

Answer 9

The derived classes are inheriting the public and protected functions/ members as private functions/ members, so everthing is hidden.
